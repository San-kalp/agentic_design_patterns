      "### Issues Found\n",
      "1. **Indentation Errors**: \n",
      "   - The indentation in the final code example is inconsistent, particularly in the `main()` function and error handling sections (lines 38-50). This will lead to a `SyntaxError` when executed.\n",
      "   - Severity: Critical\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Output Message**:\n",
      "   - The output message states \"Please enter only positive integers.\" However, it should state \"Please enter a non-negative integer.\" to align with the task requirements (line 30).\n",
      "   - Severity: Minor\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Uncommented Recursive Function**:\n",
      "   - The recursive function is commented out without any explanation on how to switch between iterative and recursive methods effectively. It would be better if there was guidance on how users can choose which method they want to use.\n",
      "   - Severity: Minor\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Redundant Code for Edge Case Handling**:\n",
      "   - In both factorial functions, edge cases are handled correctly; however, there's no explicit mention of handling large values of n that could lead to recursion depth errors or performance issues with large integers in Python.\n",
      "   - Severity: Important \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Lack of Documentation for Functions**:\n",
      "    - There are no docstrings provided for any functions (`factorial_iterative`, `factorial_recursive`, or `main`). Adding these would improve readability and maintainability by explaining what each function does.\n",
      "    - Severity: Minor \n",
      "\n",
      "6. **No Option for User Choice Between Iterative/Recursive Methods**:\n",
      "    - While both methods are defined, there’s no user prompt allowing them to choose which method they prefer at runtime; this could enhance usability.\n",
      "    - Severity: Important \n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "- Clear structure and logical flow throughout the instructions make it easy for beginners to follow along.\n",
      "- Good use of input validation through try-except blocks ensures that invalid inputs do not crash the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "1. Fix indentation issues throughout your code (especially lines 38-50) so that it runs without syntax errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Update output messages where necessary—specifically change line 30's message about non-negative integers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Consider providing clearer instructions on how users can uncomment one approach over another or allow them an option during execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Add documentation strings (docstrings) at the beginning of each function explaining their purpose and parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Include a note regarding potential performance issues when calculating factorials for very large numbers due to recursion limits or computational time with iterative approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Implement an option within your main loop allowing users to select either iterative or recursive calculation before proceeding with computation based on their choice.\n",

      "   - **Severity**: Minor\n",
      "   - **Suggestion**: Ensure consistent indentation throughout the code block.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Potential Recursion Depth Issue**:\n",
      "   - While not explicitly an error in this context, using recursion for large values of `n` can lead to a `RecursionError`. This should be noted in documentation or handled more gracefully.\n",
      "   - **Severity**: Important\n",
      "   - **Suggestion**: Consider adding a check for large inputs when using recursion or provide guidance on maximum input limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Input Validation Message Clarity (Lines 27-29)**:\n",
      "   - The message \"Please enter a non-negative integer.\" could be improved by specifying that zero is valid as well.\n",
      "   - **Severity**: Minor\n",
      "   - **Suggestion**: Update the message to clarify that zero is acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Redundant Input Validation Check (Lines 19-21)**:\n",
      "    - The check for negative integers occurs twice; once before calling either method and again after converting input into an integer.\n",
      "    - This redundancy can be streamlined by validating only once after conversion.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Fix indentation issues consistently across all lines within blocks of code to avoid syntax errors during execution (specifically at Line 43).\n",
      "2. Consider documenting potential limitations regarding recursion depth when using very high values of `n`.\n",
      "3. Improve clarity in user messages related to valid inputs—specifically mentioning that zero is included as a valid option when prompting users about non-negative integers.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Indentation Error** (Line 43):\n",

      "   - **Severity**: Minor\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Recursion Depth Warning Logic**:\n",
      "   - While there is a warning for recursion depth issues, it could be improved by actually checking if `n` exceeds Python's recursion limit before calling the recursive function instead of just warning about it.\n",
      "   - This would prevent unnecessary attempts to calculate large factorials recursively which will lead to a runtime error.\n",
      "   - **Severity**: Important\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Input Handling for Non-integer Values**:\n",
      "   - If a user inputs something that cannot be converted to an integer (like letters or special characters), this will raise an exception that is caught but does not provide specific feedback on what went wrong beyond \"Input must be a non-negative integer.\"\n",
      "   - A more user-friendly message could enhance usability.\n",
      "   - **Severity**: Important\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Redundant Import Statement Inside Function (`sys`)**:\n",
      "    - The import statement for `sys` should ideally be at the top of the file rather than inside the main function to adhere to best practices regarding imports in Python scripts.\n",
      "    - **Severity**: Minor \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Output Formatting Consistency**\n",
      "    - The output message could include additional formatting or context (e.g., specifying whether iterative or recursive method was used) for clarity when displaying results.\n",
      "    - This can help users understand how their result was computed better.\n",
      "    - **Severity:** Minor \n",

      "\n",
      "- The program correctly implements both iterative and recursive approaches as required by the task description, providing flexibility based on user preference.\n",

      "- Clear documentation through docstrings enhances readability and maintainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Fix indentation at line 43 so that `result = factorial_recursive(n)` aligns properly within its block.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Improve recursion depth handling by checking if `n` exceeds limits before attempting calculation rather than just issuing warnings after.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Enhance error messages during input conversion failures by catching specific exceptions like `ValueError`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Move all import statements outside functions at the beginning of your script for better organization.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Indentation**: Fixed indentation issues consistently across all lines within blocks, particularly at line `43`.\n",
      "- **Recursion Depth Warning**: Added logic to warn users when they attempt to calculate large values recursively that might exceed Python's default recursion limit. Users are given an option whether they want to proceed with such calculations.\n",
      "- **Clarified Input Validation Message**: Updated messages related to valid inputs explicitly stating that zero is included as acceptable.\n",
      "- **Streamlined Input Validation Checks**: Removed redundant checks by validating negative integers only once after converting user input into an integer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This refined version should enhance both functionality and usability while adhering closely to best practices in Python programming.\n"
